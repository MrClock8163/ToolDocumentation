# Welcome MrClock's tool documentations

This site provides help and documentation for the tools made by me.

!!! note

    This documentation is in active development.

### About the tools

The tools listed here are made to assist in mod development for the Arma 3 game of Bohemia Interactive.

These programs were written mainly for personal comfort and serve niche purposes, but some of them are made public for use of anyone who finds them useful.

!!! warning

    The tools are not widely tested on computers, they may not run correctly on any machine. Use them at your own discretion, and report any issues you encounter in those that are still maintained.

### Download

The tools can be downloaded from the [Google Drive ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P9WmoGLcbxL0iQok9j2K-zIBmDWNNJPD) folder of the Just Like The Simulations mod projects.
The different versions and tools are grouped by the environment they were written in.

These include:

* Python 3.8 with appJar UI library
* Visual Basic .Net 5.0 with Windows Forms UI
* Visual Bsaic .Net Framework 4.8 with WPF UI
