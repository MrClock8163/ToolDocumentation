Color library and converter
===========================

The Color library and converter is the fourth iteration of the color converter tool, and the second iteration of the integrated color library.
It is written in Visual Basic .Net Framework. It integrates the converter part of the original iteration
with a structured color library which allows for categories as well, and a color picker window.
