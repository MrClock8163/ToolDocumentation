	This page is about the **Visual Basic .Net** version of the tool. If you want to read about the Python based iteration, head over to the [Color converter (Python)](../python/colorconverter.md) page.

This Color converter is a rewrite of the original Color converter written in Python. This version is written in Visual Basic .Net, and can be ran from a compiled executable.

Improvements for this version include a UI that is easier to navigate, a color panel that allows to preview the converted color, and displays the HEX color code.

This version also makes it possible to save colors to a [formatted plain text file](../formats/libraryTXT.md), and load them back in when needed.
